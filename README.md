# admay/point-in-poly

I did an interview 5 years ago with a company that I don't remember where I had to build an API that, given a set of coordinates, would return the US state that those coords belong to.
I did it and so now here's a library.

## Usage

Run the project's tests:

    $ clojure -T:build test

Run the project's CI pipeline and build a JAR:

    $ clojure -T:build ci

This will produce an updated `pom.xml` file with synchronized dependencies inside the `META-INF`
directory inside `target/classes` and the JAR in `target`. You can update the version (and SCM tag)
information in generated `pom.xml` by updating `build.clj`.

Install it locally (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build install

Deploy it to Clojars -- needs `CLOJARS_USERNAME` and `CLOJARS_PASSWORD` environment
variables (requires the `ci` task be run first):

    $ clojure -T:build deploy
